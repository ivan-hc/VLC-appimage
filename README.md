This repository provides AppImages of VLC Stable and the GIT versions based on JuNest, the lightweight Arch Linux based distro that runs, without root privileges, on top of any other Linux distro. Learn more about JuNest and the ArchImage project:

- JuNest https://github.com/fsquillace/junest
- ArchImage https://github.com/ivan-hc/ArchImage

*NOTE: the 32-bit version for the old i386 architectures is available at [ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database](https://github.com/ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database), download it from [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database/releases/tag/vlc).*

### NOTE: from September 30, 2025, the "VLC with Plugins" build has been merged with the "Stable" build.

**The "continuous-with-plugins" tag will no longer be updated. Please rely on the "[continuous](https://github.com/ivan-hc/VLC-appimage/releases/tag/continuous)" tag.**

**Weekly snapshots will be created to ensure VLC remains usable in case new bugs are introduced upstream.**

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
